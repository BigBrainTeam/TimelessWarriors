### Combat Mechanics

A character in Timeless Warriors has three different types of attacks, Light, Special and the Ultimate.
- Light attacks are quick attacks and safe attacks, but they don't dish as much damage as their counterparts. Each character has five different Light Attacks, Side Attack, Up Attack, Side Air Attack, Up Air Attack and Down Air Attack. Also, Side Attack can be charged for increased damage and knockback.

- Special attacks are hard hitting, slow attacks which are used to knock an opponent out with ease when their hp starts to get low. Each character has three different Special Attacks,
Side Special, Up Special and Down Special. As Light Side Attack, the Side Special Attack can be charged for increased power.

- The final attack of each character is called the Ultimate Attack, these is an attack of immense power, which can turn the tides of battle. To be able to perform this attack, a character must first charge their energy bar. This bar is increased by dealing and receiving damage from attacks.

To be able to avoid getting damaged, a character has access to two different mechanics: Dodge and Parry. 
- A player can dodge any direction either in the air or on the ground, allowing the avoidance of attacks during a short amount of time.
- Parrying consists of blocking an attack at the exact moment it is about to hit the character. Succesfully performing a parry will stun the opponent temorarily allowing for an attack opportunity to counter.
