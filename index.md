## Combat Mechanics

A character in Timeless Warriors has three different types of attacks, Light, Special and the Ultimate.
- Light attacks are quick attacks and safe attacks, but they don't dish as much damage as their counterparts. Each character has five different Light Attacks, Side Attack, Up Attack, Side Air Attack, Up Air Attack and Down Air Attack. Also, Side Attack can be charged for increased damage and knockback.

- Special attacks are hard hitting, slow attacks which are used to knock an opponent out with ease when their hp starts to get low. Each character has three different Special Attacks,
Side Special, Up Special and Down Special. As Light Side Attack, the Side Special Attack can be charged for increased power.

- The final attack of each character is called the Ultimate Attack, these is an attack of immense power, which can turn the tides of battle. To be able to perform this attack, a character must first charge their energy bar. This bar is increased by dealing and receiving damage from attacks.

To be able to avoid getting damaged, a character has access to two different mechanics: Dodge and Parry. 
- A player can dodge any direction either in the air or on the ground, allowing the avoidance of attacks during a short amount of time.
- Parrying consists of blocking an attack at the exact moment it is about to hit the character. Succesfully performing a parry will stun the opponent temorarily allowing for an attack opportunity to counter.

## Maps

Timeless Warriors features five different maps at the time:

- Pirate Island: The pirate island is a caribbean themed map which features four platforms, two of which are main platforms but with an empty space in between which can divide the fight into two separate ones, or even cause some sneaky death in the middle.
- Black Castle: This dark themed map is made out of four platforms, two of which are outside of the main area, creating dangerous zones to fight in as they can result into early kills.
- Samurai Tower: The samurai tower is a japanese themed map made out of three platforms, one being the main one and the others on top. This is a basic layout to promote fighting but also allow some interesting options with the platforms on top.
- Valhalla: Valhalla is a brutal map with norse theme, which contain one large main platform and a small one over it, promoting viscious fights. It also contains a twist, every couple minutes, the whole map will turn upside down, creating confusion and opportunity to strike the opponents.
- Stadium: The Stadium is the most basic map, which consists only of a big main platform. This map is pure chaos and fight, theres nowhere to run, only fighting is allowed in the Stadium.
